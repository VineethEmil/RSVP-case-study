# RSVP-case-study
A simple case study to find information on which movie project to work on.
this is an SQL file to analyse IMDB data to try and figure out which actor, actress, director etc.. whould work best with a production house to bring out the best movie possible; analytically speaking.
The SQL script I use contains questions which I have answered one after the other to bring about objective conclusions
