# RSVP-case-study
A simple case study to find information on which movie project to work on.
this is an SQL file to analyse IMDB data to try and figure out which actor, actress, director etc.. whould work best with a production house to bring out the best movie possible; analytically speaking.
The SQL script I use contains questions which I have answered one after the other to bring about objective conclusions
All in all this is a beginner friendly SQL script to help you with basic to intermediate syntaxes
The dataset for the same has been fetched from Kaggle's public domian for practice purposes only.
**Business objective**

you need to decide on which person should be given a certain job in the filmmaking schedule to make the likelyhood of creating the picture with the best chances of earning huge profits to the production company
